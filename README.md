 This Simon Game has been created using HTML, CSS and  JAVASCRIPT.
 The object of the game is to repeat a series of random tile clicks created by the game. After each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex which makes it harder to remember.
 Typically, youâ€™ll have four different tiles, each with a unique colour and sound which is activated when pressed. The sound aids the player in remembering the sequence and the game ends if the player misses a step in the sequence, provided 
 the game is being played in the STRICT mode.

Have fun ;)
